## Number System
In mathematics, a number system is a set of symbols used to represent values, count quantities, perform arithmetic operations, determine orders, and compare amounts. 

**Popular number systems:** 
- The *Base 10 (Decimal)* number system is the most commonly used, which uses ten distinct symbols 0-9 to represent values zero to nine. 
- In the field of computer science, the *Base 2 (Binary)* and *Base 16 (Hexadecimal)* number systems are commonly used. The Binary number system uses two distinct symbols 0 and 1 to represent values zero and one. The Hexadecimal number system uses sixteen distinct symbols, with the numeric symbols 0-9 to represent values zero to nine, and alphabets A, B, C, D, E and F (or a-f) to represent values ten to fifteen.
- For measuring time, the *Base 60 (Sexagesimal)* number system is used, where one hour of time is divided into 60 minutes, and one minute is divided into 60 seconds. The time measurement of "8 hours, 28 minutes and 32 seconds" is represented by three Base 60 numbers as 8:28:32.

**Some of number systems and names:** 
- Binary (Base 2) , Ternary (Base 3), Quaternary (Base 4), Quinary (Base 5), Senary (Base 6), Septenary (Base 7), Octal (Base 8), Nonary (Base 9), Decimal (Base 10), Undenary (Base 11), Duodenary (Base 12), Tridecimal (Base 13), Tetradecimal (Base 14), Pentadecimal (Base 15), Hexadecimal (Base 16), Vigesimal (Base 20), Hexavigesimal (Base 26), Septemvigesimal (Base 27), Trigesimal (Base 30), Duotrigesimal (Base 32), and Sexagesimal (Base 60).
